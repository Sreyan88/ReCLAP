This is the official implementation of our paper [ReCLAP: Improving Zero Shot Audio Classification by Describing Sounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11768).


Training data, and checkpoints can be downloaded from [ReCLAP's Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZUf3HNo8wO2Ec6_cfQ0nc1fUknkHSP9e?usp=sharing).

### Setup üèãÔ∏è
```shell
conda create -n reclap python=3.10
conda activate reclap
cd ReCLAP
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Update the path to training csv (--train-data) validation csv (--val-data) and pretrained HTSAT checkpoint (--pretrained-audio) in `run.sh` file.
The csvs can be downloaded from [ReCLAP's Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZUf3HNo8wO2Ec6_cfQ0nc1fUknkHSP9e?usp=sharing).

To run the training:

```
cd ReCLAP/train/src/laion_clap
sh run.sh
```

The checkpoint for CLAP 2.3M (tiny) and ReCLAP Base can be donwloaded from [ReCLAP's Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZUf3HNo8wO2Ec6_cfQ0nc1fUknkHSP9e?usp=sharing).
The CLAP 2.3M (base) will be uploaded soon.
